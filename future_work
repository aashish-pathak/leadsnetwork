	* UI Modifications:
		- Changing background to linkedin-background
		- Font color : black (with light shadow effects)
		- Removing results_header from header_div and fixing it in results_div
		- Fixing table header
	
	* Ranking algorithm for leads:
		- fetching data for all leads (one time) :
			- to fetch contacts, designation, experience, organization, current-city
		- Static ranking based on stored information
		- Fetching profile (of query-person) through random lead to look for current-city, school, college, organization
		- Calculating final weight of all leads for corresponding query-person
		- Fetching query-person's profile through all sorted leads to look for distance
	
	* Storing result logs:
		- Storing query-person and all of his/her search results into a file for further use
		- machine learning on such data leading to results close to optimal results (future work)
